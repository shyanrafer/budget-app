## Description

I have grown weary of tracking my expenses by hand and don't want to download another budget app. I seek to make my own tool with the tools I now possess having completed the coding course. This is the budgeting app to end all other budgeting apps. The interface is to be as slick and smooth as possible. I aim to implement many tools for easy data gethering and interpretation.
